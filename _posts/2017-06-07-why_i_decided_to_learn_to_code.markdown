I probably knew for some time I wanted a job in the Technology Field. I wasn't interested in hardware or helpdesk jobs. Nothing against them, but it just didn't make me curious. Over a year ago, while browsing https://arstechnica.com, I come across an article on the Silk Road case. For those of you unfamiliar with this, I would suggest to grab some coffee and bites, prop a pillow on the couch and Google it. This real life occurrence will leave you stunned. And therein began my journey trying to understand the intricacies of the web - surface and deep - and figure out how Information Security works. So i decided to pursue a Bachelors' Degree in IT(Security) from WGU, and I am currently half way through my graduation. However, I still felt something missing, and that was the ability to understand the front end of the web, and how code actually works. And like an answer from the heavens, I came across Flatiron School. 

I pondered for couple of days and enrolled in their free bootcamp. I also applied for their Women Take Tech Scholarship, and was getting really nervous about not being selected. I weighed the pros and cons (if any) of enrolling in their Online Web Development Program, and the fact that they have such an amazing support system coupled with a job guarantee helped me decide that I will join, if I get selected for the scholarship. I was lucky enough to be chosen, and here I am :-)

Hopefully I can complete this journey successfully, irrespective of the roadblocks along the way, and use my knowledge of code coupled with my degree in InfoSec to be a meaningful contributor to our ever expanding digital world!
